42,Which prime minister has been in office between 2017 and 2022 and also shares their middle name with a former monarch of Scotland.,[''],"The Prime Minister who was in office between 2017 and 2022 is Boris Johnson. His full name is Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson, and his middle name, ""Boris,"" shares a similarity with ""Borthwick,"" which is not a former monarch of Scotland. However, to clarify, this specific query seems to relate primarily to the name Alexander, which is not relevant here as ""Boris"" does not correspond to a Scottish monarch. 

If the query is more focused on the middle name ""Alexander,"" that may correspond with historical figures, such as Alexander I of Scotland. However, Boris Johnson's direct connection here is tenuous without specific alignment to monarch names. 

So, it's crucial to note that while Boris Johnson was the Prime Minister during that time, the main content requested concerning a shared middle name with a former Scottish monarch is complex and may lead to confusion without clear historical context.

46,Was the founder of the bank that was established 42 years before the National Banking Act was expanded to include the Territory of Hawai'i still alive when it acquired Pioneer Federal Savings Bank?,[''],"To answer your question, we need to find a timeline for the establishment of the bank, the expansion of the National Banking Act to include the Territory of Hawai'i, and the acquisition of Pioneer Federal Savings Bank.

1. The National Banking Act was passed in 1863, and it was expanded to include the Territory of Hawai'i in 1900. Therefore, 42 years before this expansion would be 1900 - 42 = 1858.

2. We need to identify the bank established in 1858. The Bank of Hawai'i was established in that year (1858).

3. Now, regarding the founder of the Bank of Hawai'i, notable figures include Samuel Parker, who was involved in its establishment.

4. The next part concerns the acquisition of Pioneer Federal Savings Bank. Pioneer Federal Savings Bank was founded in 1959 and later acquired by BancWest Corporation in 2000.

Now we need to check if the founder of the Bank of Hawai'i (who was active around 1858) was still alive in 2000 when Pioneer Federal Savings Bank was acquired. Samuel Parker was born in 1827 and passed away in 1886. 

Given that Samuel Parker died in 1886, he was not alive in 2000 when Pioneer Federal Savings Bank was acquired. 

Therefore, the answer to your question is **No**, the founder of the bank established 42 years before the National Banking Act was expanded to include the Territory of Hawai'i was not alive when Pioneer Federal Savings Bank was acquired.",No,0.8571428571428571,0.904586435954486,0.2833275069629422,0.7672857046127319
