1. Damon Wayans joined *Saturday Night Live* in 1985. His first episode aired on November 16, 1985.
2. *In Living Color* premiered on April 15, 1990, with Wayans as a significant part of the cast.

Now, we can calculate the number of days between these two dates, including the premiere days:

- From November 16, 1985, to November 16, 1986: 365 days (1986 was not a leap year)
- From November 16, 1986, to November 16, 1987: 365 days
- From November 16, 1987, to November 16, 1988: 365 days
- From November 16, 1988, to November 16, 1989: 365 days
- From November 16, 1989, to April 15, 1990: 151 days

Now, we add these up:
365 + 365 + 365 + 365 + 151 = 1,911 days

Therefore, the total number of days from Damon Wayans's first episode as a cast member of *Saturday Night Live* to his first episode as a cast member of *In Living Color*, including the premiere days, is **1,911 days**.",1619 days.,0.0,0.14285714285714285,0.9467340864740335,0.08304169459716593

If it occurred before October 31, 1751, we would subtract his birth year (1674) from the year of the donation and adjust based on whether the donation took place before or after October 20th of that year for exact age.
